#### Methods summary: 

The authors assembled an experiment where 5-years-olds learned a set of pictures with pairs of objects associated to a cartoon character to investigate the effects of consolidation on children's memory by introducing a 1 min delay between learning and testing in the no-delay experiment. Three learning phases, 1 and 3 presented identical contingencies and 2 different contingencies. Darby & Sloutsky (2015) also evaluated the results for interference and savings following a 2 (phase: 1 vs. 3) × 2 (pair type: overlapping vs. unique) analysis of variance (ANOVA). 

------

#### Target outcomes: 

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> No-delay condition. Results in the no-delay condition pointed to substantial retroactive interference, which was confirmed by a 2 (phase: 1 vs. 3) × 2 (pair type: overlapping vs. unique) repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), which revealed a significant interaction, F(1, 24) = 13.04, p = .001, ηp 2 = .35. Planned comparisons indicated that accuracy significantly decreased for overlapping pairs, t(24) = 6.82, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.39, but not for unique pairs, p = .46. To determine the extent of retroactive interference effects on children’s memory, we also measured savings effects. Results pointed to savings for unique but not for overlapping pairs: A 2 (phase: 1 vs. 3) × 2 (pair type: overlapping vs. unique) repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction, F(1, 22) = 12.02, p = .002, ηp 2 = .33, with savings transpiring for unique pairs, t(24) = 5.82, p < .001, d = 1.19, but not for overlapping pairs, p = .56. Substantial retroactive interference coupled with no savings for overlapping pairs points to catastrophic- like levels of retroactive interference, which replicates our previous findings (Darby & Sloutsky, 2015).

We also attempted to reproduce Figure 2 Experiment 1 No Delay only.

# Step 5: Conclusion

The findings of this replication suggest a substantial retroactive interference confirmed by the analysis of variance with savings only for unique pairs, but not for overlapping pairs. The t-test analysis suggest that accuracy decrease fro overlapping pairs and increase for unique pairs. 

The reproducibility check was not a failure, but parts of the study were not replicated. The description of the analysis of variance on page 1940 are ambiguous and it is not clear what the authors did in the analysis. Therefore, when running the anova, I was not clear on which ones are the variables under consideration in the model and the nature of the model.

# Assess the causal locus (discrete reproducibility issues) of any reproducibility errors. Note that there doesn't necessarily have to be a one-to-one correspondance between discrete reproducibility issues and reproducibility errors. For example, it could be that the original article neglects to mention that a Greenhouse-Geisser correct was applied to ANOVA outcomes. This might result in multiple reproducibility errors, but there is a single causal locus (discrete reproducibility issue).

This is a subjective judgement, but you should taking into account multiple factors, such as the presence/absence of decision errors, the number of target outcomes that could not be reproduced, the type of outcomes that could or could not be reproduced, the difference in magnitude of effect sizes, and the predictions of the specific hypothesis under scrutiny.
